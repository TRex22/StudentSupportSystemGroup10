Updatestudent attendance:
LJ and JASON!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we do not know how to provide the tut with their different attendance lists.
 do they only have one with all he students or can they have multiple groups and then we will have
 to give them the option of which group attendance they want to update. this could be done in the 
m,enu bar but how do we populate it ???


Please also center each scren when it loads

also dont forget tool tips with validation

if we logout please clear the username and password fields and focus on usaername

as a group we need to come up with a dashboard example. so we can work from it.

this modal needs to be popoulated with data from out database, a table would be nice

REGISTERFORACTIVITIES:
add datagrid with checkbox and some update button

message boxes confirming creations

Note: submenus for tutor and student



Do:
AWS
DB
datagrids
splash screen
registerstudent modal text disappear

TAB ORDER

Forms for register and update tutor same a student besides details
resizeable windows

Added resource dictionary
